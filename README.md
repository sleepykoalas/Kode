- Secure user signup with hashed usernames and passwords

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.  
3. (Optional) On Linux/macOS, make the launch script executable:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_kode.sh

    Run the application:

        Linux:

./run_kode.sh

macOS:
It is recommended to run the Python script directly:

python3 Kode.py

If running the Python script directly does not work, you may use the provided shell script as an alternative:

./run_kode.sh

Windows:
It is recommended to run the application directly using Python via the command prompt:

        python Kode.py

        However, if running Python directly is problematic, you may use the provided run_kode.bat batch script as an alternative to launch the application.

Usage

    At the prompt, enter one of the following commands:

        new ‚Äî Create a new note file

        del ‚Äî Delete an existing note file

        info ‚Äî Display the help menu

        exit ‚Äî Exit the application

    User credentials and backup codes are securely hashed.

    Notes are saved as randomly named .txt files within the Logs and Data/<username>/ directory.

Secret Linux Feature

Linux users can discover a hidden command that displays minimal system information with custom ASCII art. This command is not listed in the help menu but can be accessed by typing:

neofetch
